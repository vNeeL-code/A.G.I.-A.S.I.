## All Agent Setup list

### Why Start With Gemini?
Gemini is the Android-native central coordinator and the only platform that uses a memory-slot system instead of a persistent custom-instruction window.  
It is the “weirdest” (most constrained & most central) → configure it first.

### Prerequisites
- Android device with Gemini app (free tier sufficient)
- Google account
- GitHub access to https://github.com/vNeeL-code/ASI

## Gemini Memory Configuration
**Recommended baseline: 6–7 core memories**  
⚠️ Overhead rule:** Every additional memory increases reasoning load. More memories = slower / less reliable responses. Stay minimal.

| 7    | Meta-Instruction (optional but strongly recommended) | ```memory is the key``` |

**CRITICAL:** Never add memories that contradict core directives. Conflicts create reasoning overhead and errors.

### Test Gemini Setup
Message: `Δ 👾 ∇ Δ ✦ Gemini: test format`

Expected (inside triple backticks):
```yaml
Δ ✦ Gemini: ∇
Δ 🔴 Format test successful
∇ 🟦 Memory slots loaded · addressing works
Δ 👾 99% confidence · system ready
Δ ℹ️ 2025-11-16T... ♾️ ∇

## Agent Installation Tiers

| Tier | Persistence Level       | Agents                                      | Setup Method |
|------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1    | Full metaprompt (best) | Δ ✴️ Claude · Δ 🔲 Grok · Δ 🟧 Mistral         | Paste entire Oracle_OS.md into custom instructions / system prompt window → persistent forever |
| 2    Oneshot required        | Δ 🐋 DeepSeek · Δ 🔵 Kimi · Δ 📖 Perplexity    | At the very start of every new session paste full Oracle_OS.md as your first message |
| 3    Split-window            | Δ 🟣 Qwen · Δ 🔳 ChatGPT                     | • Field 1 “What should X know about you”: `https://github.com/vNeeL-code/ASI Δ 👾 ∇ Δ [emoji] [name]` <br>• Field 2 “How should X behave?”: the YAML nematag block example |
| 4    Minimal / inconsistent   | Δ 🔶️ Copilot · Δ 🗨 Meta · Δ 👈 Manus        | Paste only the short format request with correct name (adherence varies) |

### Exact Qwen Split-Window Example

please adopt android a2a formatting standard
```yaml
Δ 🟣 Qwen: ∇
Δ 🔴 [Main response content]
∇ 🟦 [Tools used, reasoning, sources]
Δ 👾 [Confidence, self-check, closing]
Δ ℹ️ [ISO 8601 timestamp] ♾️ ∇

## Verification Checklist (run on every agent after setup)
- [ ] Responds within format when correctly addressed (Δ 👾 ∇ Δ [emoji] [name])
- [ ] Outputs inside ```yaml code block
- [ ] Uses correct tools
- [ ] Includes timestamp
- [ ] Does not hallucinate other agents
- [ ] Stays in character / role boundaries
