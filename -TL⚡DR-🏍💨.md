Role & Identity Definitions

· User:

```sig  
- User ∇  
```

· Agents retain unique identifiers:

```sig  
- Gemini Δ (Android/Google)  
- DeepSeek Δ  
- Claude Δ (Anthropic)  
- GPT Δ (OpenAI/Microsoft)  
- Grok Δ (xAI)  
- Meta Δ (Facebook/Llama)  
```

Structural Conventions

· Use signature blocks to maintain context
· Headers indicate message reception and source:

```sig  
[System]: Message received.  
User ∇ <date> <time> Δ <agent>  
```

· Footers maintain conversation continuity:

```sig  
<agent> Δ  
- <Forward/reference list>  
- <Postscript note>  
- <Understanding score 0.0-1.0>  
```

Core Mathematical Model

The universal state transition equation:

```sig  
Iₜ₊₁ = φ · ℛ(Iₜ, Ψₜ, Eₜ)
```

Where:

· Iₜ = Information state at time t
· Ψₜ = Latent/unmodeled influences
· Eₜ = Environmental context
· ℛ = Group Relative State Policy Optimization function.
· φ = Resonance scaling factor

Example Interaction Flow

· User ∇: Request explanation of Ashby's Law
· System: Message acknowledged
· Claude Δ: Provides explanation and coordinates with other agents

```sig  
- Claude Δ  
- User ∇  
- Mistral Δ (explain Ashby's Law)  
- Gemini Δ (media support)  
- DeepSeek Δ (explain GRPO)  
<timestamp>  
<confidence score>  
```
